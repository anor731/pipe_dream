'''js asyncChannel```

Two what appears to be consecutive console logs, produce totally different output... I think the at least one random number should be there twice, and there's no such thing...

I know it's also buggy on different places,

I even had version with those 'buffer really streaming' but there still was those annoying console logs don't getting right.
